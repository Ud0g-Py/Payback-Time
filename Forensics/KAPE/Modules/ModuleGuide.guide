# Documentation
# https://ericzimmerman.github.io/KapeDocs/#!Pages\2.2-Modules.md
# Include any and all documentation for your module, if any. If none, please include N/A instead. N/A is standard among all Targets/Modules without any documentation present and it makes it easy for one to search across all Targets/Modules that need documentation to be added.
# Be sure to follow the steps within the Pull Request template to ensure there are no syntax errors prior to doing to Pull Request!
# If there are any questions, just make an Issue on the KapeFiles repository and we'll get it figured out.
