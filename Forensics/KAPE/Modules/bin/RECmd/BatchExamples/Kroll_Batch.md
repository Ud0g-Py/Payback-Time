# Documentation

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/windows-registry-advanced-users

# Guidelines

If you're not going to `Recursive: true` on a key or subkey, please prepend with a `Category -> Description` comment before the series of multiple entries for the values to be parsed
In the above instance, if possible, save all documentation for the last entry in a series, unless a specific helpful reference exists for a given `ValueName`
If an entry is using a Plugin to generate output, please include a comment about which Plugin is being used below that entry in this batch file.
