# Documentation
# home.db: SQlite database which appears to keep track of the user's recent Dropbox activity
# icon.db: SQLite database which appears to keep track of icons in the user's Dropbox sync history which can give an indication as to which files and folders are present
# sync_history.db: SQLite database which appears to keep track of the user's Dropbox sync history
# nucleus.sqlite3: SQLite database which appears to contain a table for deleted files

# The SQLite database(s) this Target collects can be parsed with SQLECmd using the following map(s): https://github.com/EricZimmerman/SQLECmd/blob/master/SQLMap/Maps/Windows_Dropbox_Configurations.smap, https://github.com/EricZimmerman/SQLECmd/blob/master/SQLMap/Maps/Windows_Dropbox_FileCache.smap, and https://github.com/EricZimmerman/SQLECmd/blob/master/SQLMap/Maps/Windows_Dropbox_InstanceDB.smap
